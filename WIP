In the `wipman clean` command, you are checking if there are any still to-do tasks before cleaning them out.

- [x] Build graph of task interdependencies
- [x] Traverse graph finding previous tasks
- [x] Check if previous tasks are incomplete
- [ ] Decide if to raise with the first one, or collect all issues
  - probably easier to raise with the first one, fail early
  - trying to collect many can lead you to very complex scenarios to handle before reporting
  - just fail with enough information on the first issue found, and done
  - you will have time to implement a more complex checking system
